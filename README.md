Package for keyboard input :
git clone https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard 
python setup.py 
(I believe it was like this? )

TODO: 
Saving of sensors/actions to csv file
I believe we could store them in a datastructure and after a time/dedicated key press write them into file?
(We want to avoid storing up data where we screw up and crash or so the key could be like a "checkpoint" and it would flush all the data into file once you say its good?)

After we have this we could make a dataset and race a few laps/ different circuits?

A few tricks:
F2 - switch camera mode(there are more but I think this is only one which lets you drive properly)

\+ and - keys on a keyboard (might be a bit different for you) let you make the game slower/faster which comes handy when you have to make sharp turn (I found it best at 0.5 speed for normal race and sometimes switched to 0.25 when there were 90 degree + turns)
